# RMS Titanic
**RMS Titanic** was a British passenger liner, operated by the White Star Line, which sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK, to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, which made the sinking possibly one of the deadliest for a single ship up to that time.[a] It remains to this day the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship. The disaster drew much public attention, provided foundational material for the disaster film genre, and has inspired many artistic works.

## Background

Titanic example is the first project that every data enthusiast starts with. There are many articles and topics that talk about the underlying statistics and data science concepts. This is an effort to make this project understandable for all those who are not versed in statistics and concepts of data science. The emphasis here is to make the machine learning models explainable to all.
