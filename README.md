# RMS Titanic
**RMS Titanic** was a British passenger liner, operated by the White Star Line, which sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on 15 April 1912 after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, UK, to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, which made the sinking possibly one of the deadliest for a single ship up to that time.[a] It remains to this day the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship. The disaster drew much public attention, provided foundational material for the disaster film genre, and has inspired many artistic works.

## Background

Titanic example is the first project that every data enthusiast starts with. There are many articles and topics that talk about the underlying statistics and data science concepts. This is an effort to make this project understandable for all those who are not versed in statistics and concepts of data science. The emphasis here is to make the machine learning models explainable to all.

# Data
Let's first explore the data set that hase been shared with us.

## Age and Sex
Certain age groups have better chances of survival. In this section we will explore the age groups that have better chances of survival over others

### Females
Females between the ages of 14 - 35 have better chances of survival.

### Males
Infants and males between ages 25-35 have better chances of survival.

### Port of Embarkation

Males and Females who embarked from port of Cherbourg have better chances of survival

### Relatives
The dataset already contains number of siblings / spouses as well as number of parents / children aboard the Titanic. We will add the two data points to identify the number of relatives on board the titanic. And identify the impact of number of relatives have on the chances of survival.
